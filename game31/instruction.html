        Game 2 has <b>5</b> rounds too. Consider yourself and the other 2 computer robots work in a group at a firm.
        You can think of a round of this game as being a workweek.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <b>each</b> week, you and your group members can each choose to spend up to <b>70 hours</b> on an activity at work.
        The payoff that you receive in a round depends on <b>the number of hours you choose to spend on the activity</b> and
        <b>the number of hours chosen by the two computer robots in your group.</b> Please note that the decisions of the two robots are <b>randomly</b> generated by the computer.
        The formula below determines your round payoff, which is the <b>minimum hours</b> of all the group
        members minus <b>0.75</b> times <b>your hours</b> plus <b>85</b> ECUs.
        The payoff table is provided for you , so you do not need to memorize this formula. This payoff table  will
        be available at any point where you need to make a decision. Your round payoffs are calculated as follows:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Your Round Payoff (ECUs) = Minimum Hours of Your Group - 0.75*Your Hours + 85 ECUs</strong>
        (Please note that ECUs are rounded up to the nearest integer)
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if you spend 70 hours on the activity, and the other two computer robots spend 70 hours and 60 hours
        respectively: then your round payoff will be 60 – 0.75*70 +85 ECUs making 93 ECUs.
        Your round payoff will be determined by tracing row 70 for 'your hours' and column 60 for 'group minimum hours' <strong>in the payoff table.</strong>
        The payoff of the group member who spent 70 will be identical. However, the payoff of the group member who
        spent 60 will be 60 - 0.75*60 + 85 ECUs making 100 ECUs.
