        Game 2 has <b>5</b> rounds too. Consider yourself and the other {{Constants.num_other_players}} participants work in a group at a firm.
        You can think of a round of this game as being a workweek.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <b>each</b> week, you and your group members can each choose to spend up to <b>70 hours</b> on an activity at work.
        The payoff that each group member receives in a round depends on <b>the number of hours she/he chooses to spend on
        the activity</b> and <b>the number of hours the {{Constants.num_other_players}} other group members choose to spend.</b>
        The formula below determines your round payoff, which is the <b>minimum hours</b> of all the group members
        minus <b>0.75</b> times <b>your hours</b> plus <b>85</b> ECUs. The payoff table is provided for you, so you do not need
        to memorize this formula. This payoff table  will be available at any point where you need to make a decision.
        Your round payoffs are calculated as follows:
    <p>
        <strong>Your Round Payoff (ECUs) = Minimum Hours of Your Group - 0.75*Your Hours + 85 ECUs</strong>
        (Please note that ECUs are rounded up to the nearest integer)
    </p>
        <p>
            For example, if you spend 70 hours on the activity, and the other {{Constants.num_other_players}} group members spend 70 hours, 10 hours and 60 hours respectively:
            then your round payoff will be 10 – 0.75*70 +85 ECUs making 43 ECUs.
            Your round payoff will be determined by tracing row 70 for 'your hours' and column 10 for 'group minimum hours' <strong>in the payoff table.</strong>
            The payoff of the group member who spent 70 will be identical. However, the payoff of the group member who
            spent 60 will be 10 - 0.75*60 + 85 ECUs making 50 ECUs.
            Finally, the payoff of the group member who spent 10 will be 10 - 0.75*10 + 85 ECUs making 88 ECUs.
