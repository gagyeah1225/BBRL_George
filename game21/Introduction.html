    <p>
    Game 1 consists of <b>5</b> rounds. In <b>each</b> round, you and 2 computer robots will receive <b>an initial endowment of
    100 ECUs</b> and then decide how much of the initial endowment to keep and how much to allocate towards a group account.
    </p>
    <p>
    For <b>each</b> ECU allocated to the group account, every group member will earn <b>0.5</b> ECUs. That is, every ECU you
    allocate to the group account will generate <b>0.5</b> ECUs for you and <b>0.5</b> ECUs each for the two computer robots in
    your group, therefore this leads to a total of 0.5*3 = <b>1.5</b> ECUs for the group per ECU allocated. Similarly,
    if a computer robot allocates 1 ECU to the group account, you and the other computer robot in your group will earn
    <b>0.5</b> ECUs each. Please note that the decisions of the two robots are <b>randomly</b> generated by the computer.
    Therefore, your round payoffs are calculated as follows:
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong> Your Round Payoffs = ECUs you keep for yourself + 0.5*(total amount allocated of all members in your group). </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you allocate 50 ECUs to the group account and keep 50 ECUs for yourself. If the total
        amount allocated to the group account is 150 ECUs. Then, your round payoff will be the ECUs you kept for yourself +
        0.5 times the total amount allocated to the group account making 125 ECUs (i.e., 50 ECUs + 75 ECUs).
