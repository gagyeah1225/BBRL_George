        In Stage 2, you and the {{ Constants.num_other_players }} other group members will play 3 decision-making games
        on the computers. You will receive instructions at the beginning of each game. Your payoffs from each game will
        depend on your decisions and the other two group members’ decisions in that game. You will be paid based on one
        randomly chosen game. Since each game has the equal probability of being chosen, it is important for you to make
        decisions in each game as if it is the one that will be chosen to compute earnings. You will not see your payoffs
        in each game or which game is chosen for earnings until the end of this stage after all the 3 games are played.
