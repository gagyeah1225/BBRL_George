    <p>
        Game 1 consists of <b>5</b> rounds. In <b>each</b> round, you and the two computer bots will have an opportunity to invest in
        a group account within 30 seconds. The round ends when the 30 seconds are up, or after you make your decision.
        Clicking the “Invest” button allows you to invest. Waiting for the 30 seconds to elapse or clicking the “Do not Invest”
        button allows you to not invest.
    </p>

    <p>
        If <b>you or the two computer bots do not invest</b> in the group by the end of a round, each group member will earn <b>50</b> ECUs.
        If you invest before the 30 seconds are up, then the computer bots will earn <b>100</b> ECUs, and you will earn <b>80</b> ECUs.
        If at least one of the computer bots invests, and you do not invest, then you will earn <b>100</b> ECUs.
    </p>
    <p>
        To summarize, there are 2 options:
        <ul>
        <li>If only one person or computer bot invests in your group account, the investor will earn 80 ECUs, and the other group members will earn 100 ECUs each.</li>
        <li>If no one in your group invests, you and the two computer bots will receive 50 ECUs each.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
