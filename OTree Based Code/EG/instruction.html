        For this task, you will be given an opportunity to get additional points. You are offered the 6 lotteries below.
        You must select one and only one of these lotteries.
        To select a lottery, click on the arrow to select your option.
        Each lottery has two possible outcomes <i>heads</i> and <i>tails</i> with <strong>50% probability of each occurring</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Your compensation for this part of the study will be determined by:
    <ul>
            <li>which of the six lotteries you select; and</li>
            <li>which of the two possible events occur.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if you select lottery 4 and <i>heads</i> occurs, you will earn 156 ECUs. If <i>tails</i> occurs, you will earn 48 ECUs.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the study, the computer will flip a virtual coin to determine which event will occur.
        If <i>heads</i> occurs, then you will get the points associated with the heads for the lottery you picked.
        Your payoff from this game will be added to the earnings from the chosen game in this part.
