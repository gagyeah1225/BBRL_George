    <h3>
        Phase I Stage 2: Instructions for the Games
    </h3>
<font size="+2">

    <p>

        In Stage 2, you and two computer bots will play 3 decision-making games on the computer.
        You will receive instructions at the beginning of each game.
        Your payoffs from each game will depend on your decisions and the computer <b>randomly</b> generated decisions of the bots.
        You will be paid based on one randomly chosen game. Since each game has the equal probability of being chosen,
        it is important for you to make decisions in each game as if it is the one that will be chosen to compute earnings.
        You will not see your payoffs in each game or which game is chosen for earnings until the end of this stage after all the 3 games are played.
