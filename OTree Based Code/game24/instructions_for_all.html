        In Stage 2, you and the {{ Constants.num_other_players }} other group members will play 3 decision-making games on the computers.
        Your payoff from game 3 will be added to the payoff from the randomly chosen game from this part.
        Otherwise, the rules are the same as before. Since a new member joined, let’s recap these rules. You will receive instructions at the beginning of each game.
        Your payoffs from each game will depend on your decisions and the other {{ Constants.num_other_players }} group members’ decisions in that game.
        You will be paid based on <b>one randomly chosen game</b> from games <b>1 and 2</b>, and <b>game 3</b>. Since each of the first two games has the equal probability of being chosen,
        it is important for you to make decisions in each game as if it is the one that will be chosen to compute earnings.
        You will not see your payoffs in each game or which game is chosen for earnings until the end of this stage after all the games are played.
